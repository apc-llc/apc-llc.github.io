Deep Learning on GPUs is currently boosting AI's massive leap into real-life applications: autopilots, intelligent automated assistants, real-time translation, image recognition, data sequencing and clustering. With the unprecedented computing power of NVIDIA GPUs, many automotive, robotics and big data companies are creating products and services based on a new class of intelligent machines.

Applied Parallel Computing LLC offers a specialized 4-day course on GPU-enabled Neural Networks. The course is intended for developers willing to rapidly get NVIDIA-based AI technology into new and existing software solutions. In 4 days we will walk from the necessary theory of Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks to practical recipes of using Tensorflow and Caffe frameworks. Finally, course attendees will be guided to build up an AI software stack for a real robot.
